# MySQL-Mock-Store
Practice using MySQL and Node.js to create a database and interact with it using the CLI.

# What does the project do?
The first iteration of the project is the customer view. This allows the user to interact with the app through the CLI and purchase items that are in stock! The purchase removes the desired item from the database and shows the user their total at the end. If the item is not in stock, the user is notified.

# How can users get started with the project?
